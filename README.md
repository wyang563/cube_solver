# cube_solver

I implement a python program that outputs a sequence of moves as per official World Cube Association notation that solves a scramble of a given 3x3 Rubik's Cube.
The program for input takes a scramble sequence or an array of the orientation of the pieces of a 3x3 cube. The Pochmann method for blind solving 3x3 Rubik's cubes
is the solving method implemented in the program, and in general averages around 250 moves.
